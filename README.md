#Kayla Jolly Hairdresser Website
WEB601 final Project files

This is my final project website called "Kayla Jolly Hairdresser"

The website is about a hairdresser's website, it has a Home Page with it's instagram page attached, it has a Services page where it displays the services of the hairdresser, it also has a portfolio page where the clients work pictures will be uploaded where the users can comment etc, the website also has a sign up page if the login button is hit.

Hence go to kaylajolly folder and do "npm start" to run the client side 

and go to the api folder and do "npm start" to open the Server side
